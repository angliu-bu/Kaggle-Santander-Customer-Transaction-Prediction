Kaggle Compitition Santander Customer Transaction Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/overview

The goal is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data that the banks have available to solve this problem.

In this project, I analyszed the features of the training data and found that many features were uncorrelated and two groups had different distribution of features. Based on that I did data augmentation and then apply a LightGBM model to train.
